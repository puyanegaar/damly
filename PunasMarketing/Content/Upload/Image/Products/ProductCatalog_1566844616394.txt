now we need to add a new item on top of

this list we're gonna call that all

genres so back in our movies component

here in component did mount method this

is where we're initializing the genres

property of the state object we need to

make a slight change here so we define a

new constant genres we set it to a new

array we spread the array that is

returned from get genres function so we

have all the existing genres and then we

can put a new object at the beginning of

this array here we set the name property

to all genres and we don't need to set

an ID because this is not a valid genre

in the database this is just an item on

top of this list okay so now we have an

array of genres we pass that here as the

value of the genres property or we can

simplify the code because the key and

value are the same we can get rid of the

repetition and that is better with this

we get all genres on the top let's

select action we get only the action

movies beautiful now let's go back to

all genres our movies disappear here's

the reason in a render method where we

are filtering the list of movies we're

checking to see if selected genre is

true see if it's true see we're

filtering the movies so we get each

movie and we make sure that the ID of

the genre of that movie equals the ID of

the selected genre in this case our

selected genre doesn't have an ID

because we only set the name property

right that's why we don't see any movies

when we select all genres to fix this

problem we need to change this condition

to something like this select a genre

dot underline ID so if selected genre

and the idea of the selector genre are

both true see then we'll apply a filter

otherwise we get all the movies let's

test out

one more time so we go to action we get

action movies we go to all genres we get

all movies beautiful but there is a tiny

issue here if I go to the second page

and then go back to the action movies we

don't see anything here even though on

the top it says showing three movies

here is the reason let's go back to all

genres as you can see we're on the

second page so when we select another

genre we are looking at the second page

of movies and that genre in this case we

only have three movies or one page in

any of these genres that's why we don't

see any movies in this table to fix this

issue whenever we change the filter we

should reset the page to one so back in

our movies component in handle genres

select method this is where we're

setting the selector genre we should

also reset current page to one this will

fix the spot let's test the application

one more time so let's go to the second

page select action we see all the action

movies comedy all the comedy movies back

to all genres we get all the movies

beautiful
